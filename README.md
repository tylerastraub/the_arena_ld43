# The Arena: A Ludum Dare 43 Compo Game
Theme: Sacrifices must be made

Our main hero, magenta box man, must fight off waves of enemies as he endures great sacrifices to continue to fight for his life. Each wave, some downgrade is applied that weakens the player or strengthens the enemies, culminating in 8 deadly waves that the player must beat.

The development of this game was unfortunately shortened by real life distractions, so total development time is only around 15 hours, which mainly cut into the creation of art and music. The entire game framework was designed from scratch as well (besides base SFML libraries), so a majority of development went towards creating a functioning engine. Regardless, this was a lot of fun to create and a lot was learned.
